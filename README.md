## Introduction
Our project topic was to implement interactive adjustable transfer functions, then compare and design the best one for different volume. The project was based on a volume rendering framework. We added interactive panels with openCV and [GLUI](git@github.com:libglui/glui.git). Some of the rendering plots are above.
